Academic – Data Science Project:

 ● 	Asteroid Classification for Near-Earth Objects (Hazardous and Non-Hazardous) 
Business Objective: To identify hazardous near-Earth objects. 
Approach: Exploratory Data Analysis was done to identify patterns and trends which contribute towards a near- Earth object being hazardous. Further Machine Learning algorithms were used to predict whether an object is hazardous or not. The final model used was the Lightgbm framework. 
Tools Used: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and Sci-Kit Learn
•	Exploratory Data Analysis for Credit Score Classification 
Business Objective: To identify trends and business patterns of customers segregated in different credit score brackets.
Approach: Data Cleaning, handling of anomalous data, handling of missing values. Analysed the data to identify patterns and trends amongst customers segregated into different credit score brackets. 
Tools used: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
•	Cancer Detection through k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Methodology
Business Objective: To detect cancer through an effective and accurate methodology..
Approach: The cancer detection process involves leveraging the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) methodology. This begins with data exploration and understanding, followed by the implementation of kNN for pattern recognition. The kNN algorithm classifies a data point based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors in the feature space. The choice of k is crucial and is determined through iterative testing for optimal performance. The methodology ensures a comprehensive analysis of cancer-related data, aiding in the accurate identification of malignancies.
Tools used: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Sci-Kit Learn.

•	Credit Card Fraud Detection Project:
Business Objective: Detect and prevent credit card fraud through a comprehensive analysis of transaction data.
Approach: Data exploration, preprocessing of anomalous data, handling of missing values. Analysed the data to identify patterns and trends amongst customers segregated into different credit score brackets different model techniques were performed Logistic regression, Decision Tree, Boosting and Lightgbm(LGBM) .
Tools used: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Sci-Kit Learn
